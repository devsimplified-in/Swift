16.2 Multi-Section Messages
Description
Some system messages may potentially exceed the maximum message length of 10,000
characters. Such messages divide into as many sections as necessary. The maximum length is
9,999 and the minimum length is 0001.
The Text block is divided into several Text blocks. This division is always done in such a way
that a block internal to the Text block has no divisions.
Each section is a message that has its own sequence number. Each section has a Basic
Header, an Application Header (if applicable), a Text block, and a Trailer block.
All sections have a first block of text that identifies the section (202) and a second block that
identifies the total number of sections that the message contains (203).
There are no multi-section messages on input.
